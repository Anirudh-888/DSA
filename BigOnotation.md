Big(O) notations: 
<br>
• 0(1) — Constant
<br>
• O(logn) — Logarithmic
<br>
• O(n)— Linear
<br>
• O(nlogn) — Linearithmic
<br>
• O(nc) — Polynomial Like Quadratic (n2), Cubic (n3) etc.
<br>
• O(cn) — Exponential (P)
<br>
• O(n!) — Factorial
<br>
When we see this image we can know that the time complexity increases with the input that is given.
<br>
Factorial for the smaller input has the highest time complexion.Meaning it takes more time even for a small input because the calculations take up a lot of time

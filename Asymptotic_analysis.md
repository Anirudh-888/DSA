Asymptotic analysis is the analysis of performance and the behaviour of the same algorithm when different input is given.
<br>
Example: Bubble Sort
<br>
If the elements are in reversed manner in the array it will take the maximum time (worst case), maximum time is known as Quadratic.
<br>
But if the elements in the input array are sorted then it takes the least time(best case), minimum time is known as linear.
<br>
But if the elements in the input array is neither sorted nor reversed then it takes the average time.

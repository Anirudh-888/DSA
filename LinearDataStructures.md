LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES: Each element is attached to its previous and next element.
<br>
     STATIC DATA STRUCTURES: The data structures that have a fixed size. Example Array
     <br>
     DYNAMIC DATA STRUCTURES: The data structures that have a variable size they are dynamic
     <br>
     They are efficient in data management as they are dynamic during runtime
     <br>
     In this data structures the data is present on the same line which allows single traversion for all the data 
     <br>
     Time complexity increases as Data size increases
     <br>
     Used mainly in the application of software

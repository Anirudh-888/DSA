Big O notation (O notation): This is the notaiton that is used to represent the upper bound of running time of an algorithm. Used to represent the worst case complexity of the algorithm.

Omega notation (Ω notation): This is the notation that is used to represent the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm. Used to represent the best case complexity of the algorithm.
<br>
Theta notation ( θ notation ): The notation that represents the upper and lower bound running time of an algorithm. Used to represent the average case complexity  of the algorithm.
